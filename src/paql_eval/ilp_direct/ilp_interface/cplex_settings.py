	# Feasopt Tolerance

	# In the case of a MIP, it serves the purpose of the absolute gap for the feasOpt model in
	# Phase I (the phase to minimize relaxation).
	# Using this parameter, you can implement other stopping criteria as well. To do so, first call
	# feasOpt with the stopping criteria that you prefer; then set this parameter to the resulting
	# objective of the Phase I model; unset the other stopping criteria, and call feasOpt again.
	# Since the solution from the first call already matches this parameter, Phase I will terminate
	# immediately in this second call to feasOpt, and Phase II will start.
	# In the case of an LP, this parameter controls the lower objective limit for Phase I of feasOpt
	# and is thus relevant only when the primal optimizer is in use.
